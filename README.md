# Little Lemon
This repository follows the react-native course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-native-course/home).

I have built a cross-platform app using React Native and Expo for a restaurant which has features such as,
1. Restaurant home page.
2. Menu with prices.
3. Navigation.
4. User input on various fields.


## Prerequisites
1. Node JS.
2. iOS simulator.
3. Expo CLI.
4. Watchman (to improve app reload performance).

## Get started
1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app.

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Press 'i' to start the app in iOS simulator.
